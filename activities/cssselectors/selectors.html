        <p id="first">List out the different ways to select an item.
            We can use ID, Class, Tag, and attributes to select an item.</p>
         <h3>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h3> 
         <p class="second">The difference is ID is naming someone. We only have one tag in ID. We cannot reuse IDs. 
            <span class="bolder">Class is okay to reuse.</span> With classes we can do lot of things. One tag has more than one class.</p>
           <h3>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h3> 
           <p>Span tag only changes the elements inline. DIV tag if you want select. Span will not cause break in the line.
            DIV tag push the entire section. DIV tag creates box to separate that certain part from the other parts.</p>
            <h3>What is the difference between a DIV tag and HEADER, MAIN, FOOTER?</h3>
             <p>DIV is used to group elements in html. It doesn't have any special purpose or meaning. It creates kind of a frame. 
                The main difference is DIV make it unites elements as one. Header, main. footer tags separate elements and divide them into different sections 
                and make it easier to change or differentiate.</p> 
            <h3>What are different ways to select a color?</h3>
            <p>There are a few ways to select colors. For example, We can use "color:" name, RGB, RGBA, Hexidecimal, and HSLa, etc. </p>
