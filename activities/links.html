    <p>Link to an outside website with an absolute link.
        Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links? - Absolute link helps us to use links from other website. Relative link works to my website only. 
        Link to another engagement assignment (something in an activity folder).
        <br><h2>List the 3 rules with relative links.</h2>
        <dl>
            <li>(.) period means you're at your current folder</li>
            <li>(..) two periods mean parent folder</li>
            <li>(/) start at the root. </li>
        </dl>
        Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag? - Navigation helps the website users to navigate the links only on your website. Links don't have to be inside a Nav tag always.</p>
