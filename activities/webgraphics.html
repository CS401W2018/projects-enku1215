            How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed? - We can use photo editors on our computers to resize it or you can use your CSS stylesheet to resize your image using ID or Class. 
            Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? - Resizing with CSS sometimes not very accurate. It doesn't change the actual image size. </p>
