        <h1>Block Tags</h1>
        <p>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags - Block tags always take the whole space and start from a new line. 
            Inline tags take the available space only and don't start from a new line.</p>
        <p>What is the margin, border, and padding? - Margin is transparent pusher. It pushes the box from the other boxes. It helps us to distinguish them. 
                Border is a border line around padding and content. Padding works as same purpose as margin but inside the border and around the content.</p>
        <p>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS? - CSS provides several units of measurement, which can be broadly categorized into:
                Relative units, absolute units, and time units.</p>
        <p>When would you use a figure tag? - Figure tag makes inline tags block tag. You can also use this tag to include media that supports the main content and may need a caption <figurecaption>.</figurecaption></p>
