            What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex? - CSS Grid is two dimensional layout and CSS flex is one dimensional layout.
             CSS flex let the kids drive the main content and it is not organized well while CSS grid let the container control the content. CSS grid is more precise.
