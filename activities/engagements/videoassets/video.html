        <p>What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube? - YouTube is big and there is a big audience. Because it is free, there might be ads. There might some privacy issues.</p>
        <p>What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform? - You can use this when you're creating an animation. Graphic Design/Animation: Transform allows scaling, rotating, or skewing elements to create dynamic visuals. Transforms are used to process and organize data.</p>
        <p>How do you stay safe online? We should use a secure connection instead of public ones. Also, we can limit your sharing your personal information online.</p>
        <p>What is the schedule for the rest of the class? - We have two more weeks until the final exam. We will work on our 
            final project for the next two weeks. We will have test in class. During the finals' week we will be presenting our final project in class.
