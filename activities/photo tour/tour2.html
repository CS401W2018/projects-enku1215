    <h2>"Samoa"</h2>
    The greeting word: "Talofa"
    <p>If I have to describe Samoa by one word, it would be "Humor". They have a good humor 
      and their show always spread joy and energy. They are known as fearless. 
      Because their fire show and coconut tree climbing are very dangerous and risky. 
      At the same time, they are very admiring.
