    <h1>Welcome to Enku's Page!</h1>
    <h2>Aloha,</h2>
    <p>My name is Enkhchimeg Zorigt from Mongolia. People call me <mark><strong>Enku</strong></mark> for short. Currently I am a student here at the Brigham Young Univesity of Hawaii. It has been already more two years since I came here. <br>I am  majoring in Business and minoring in Chinese. I am taking an elementary Chinese this semester. It has been very challenging because I started from zero!<br> However, I love learning new things. In addition, I do not want to give up! <br> Becauce if we believe in ourselves and put enough effort, we can do everything.</p>
    <p> My favorite Quote is:</p>
    <blockquote><em><strong>"Whether you think you can or think, you can't <mark>You're Right!"</mark></strong></em></blockquote>

    <h4>Some of my favorite things to do:</h4>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>I love hiking. I am an outdoor person.</li>
        <li>I love to dance for fun. I am taking "Hula dance" class this semester.</li>
        <li>I love painting. It is my stress reliever.</li>
    </ol>
     <p>The reason why I chose Web Design class is I want to learn to create web pages, so later I create a webpage for my businesses. I like this class. Everything is good so far.</p><hr>
