        <h2>Spy Family</h2> 
        <p>It is a popular Japanese series anime written by <a href="hero.html" class="third">Tatsuya Endo</a> in 2022. The story is about a spy who had to create his own family for his mission to maintain peace between two fictional nations, Westalis and Ostania. 
            The main character spy guy's name is "Twilight". Under his mission, he adopted a girl from orphanage, her name is Anya who has an ability to read whats in others' mind. Then he started his journey to find a fake wife and he found "Yor" who an assassin. 
           What an interesting mix of people! <br> This anime is about their funny and romantic journey of how their fake family turn into a real family. <br>They begin to care for each other and fall in love with each other.</p>
        <h2>Why do I like Spy x Family? </h2>
        <p>I love Japanese culture and their language. When I was studying Japanese, I would watch animes a lot. They are funny and I love anime characters. Spy family is my recent favorite anime. I love the story, it is fun and full of mysterious and exciting things. My favorite character is Anya, in the anime she goes by "Anya Chan". Another reason I like this anime is I always learn something or inspired by the characters.</p>
