        <h2>Spy Family</h2> 
        <p>It is a popular Japanese series anime written by <a href="hero.html">Tatsuya Endo</a> in 2022. The story is about a spy who had to create his own family for his mission to maintain peace between two fictional nations, Westalis and Ostania.

        <h2>Why do I like Spy x Family? </h2>
        <p>I love Japanese culture and their language. When I was studying Japanese, I would animes a lot. They are funny and I love anime characters. Spy family is my recent favorite anime. I love the story, it is fun and full of mysterious and exciting things. My favorite character is Anya, in the anime she goes by "Anya Chan". Another reason I like this anime is I always learn something or inspired by the characters.</p>
