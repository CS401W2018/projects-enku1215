        <p><h2>Spy Family</h2> It is a popular Japanese series anime written by <a href="hero.html">Tatsuya Endo</a> in 2022. The story is about a spy who had to create his own family for his mission to maintain peace between two fictional nations, Westalis and Ostania.<br> 
        The main character spy guy's name is "Twilight". Under his mission, he adopted a girl from orphanage, her name is Anya who has an ability to read whats in others' mind. Then he started his journey to find a fake wife and he found "Yor" who an assassin. 
        What an interesting mix of people! <br> This anime is about their funny and romantic journey of how their fake family turn into a real family. <br>They begin to care for each other and fall in love with each other.  </p>
        <p><h2>Why I like Spy x Family? </h2> 
        <br> I love Japanese culture and their language. When I was studying Japanese, I would animes a lot. They are funny and I love anime characters. Spy family is my recent favorite anime. I love the story, it is fun and full of mysterious and exciting things. <br> My favorite character is Anya, in the anime she goes by "Anya Chan". 
        <br> Another reason I like this anime is I always learn something or inspired by the characters. </p>
