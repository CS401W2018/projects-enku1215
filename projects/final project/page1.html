       <p>Homepage, with responsive navigation. This means you need a viewport meta tag and a media query 
        that adjusts your navigation to be vertical and the link to be bigger buttons.
        Your navigation should also highlight the current link of your page. 
        2 Content pages. The content on these pages should also be responsive and work well on mobile devices.
        Your table should be on 1 of your content pages. Keep in mind that just a table on a page is not enough 
        content. The table should have a caption and there should be enough other content to allow your visitors 
        to understand why you are presenting them with a table of information.
        Although not required for this update, your final project needs to have 
        5 outside references that do not come from you. You should think about including a few now.</p>
