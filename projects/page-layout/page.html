         <p>&nbsp;"Trick or Treat" has been a tradition in many countries for years. However, most of us don't know where the practice is first began. From almost a 1000 year ago in Celtic's land. 
            They used to believe that at the beginning of November, the spirit world opens its door and the death spirit visit their families. 
            People who didn't have much would go to the homes of rich families to receive some food for praying for their death relatives. This practice, called "souling," was later done by children, who would go door to door asking for gifts like food, money, or ale.</p>
         <p>Later, it became very popular in England. In Scotland and Ireland, eventually this turned to ask for food or money. Before they had candies, they used to give coins away, but nowadays, people give tons of candies. 
            The interesting fact is halloween is a time of the year that most candies are purchased.
